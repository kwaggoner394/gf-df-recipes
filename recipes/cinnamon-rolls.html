    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>the softest gluten free, vegan cinnamon rolls ever</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups gluten free flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup coconut or cane sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum (extra, even if your flour contains it)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups warm water (110-115 degrees F)</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon cane sugar or honey</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup oil (avocado or grapeseed)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup coconut or cane sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li> 1/3 cup softened coconut oil or 1/2 cup softened vegan butter
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup softened coconut oil or vegan butter</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons-1/4 cup milk of choice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>   
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a measuring glass combine warm water and cane sugar, stirring to combine. Add in the yeast, and stir together briefly. Let it sit until it's foamy (5-7 minutes).</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a mixer (a hand mixer will also work), combine the flour, coconut or cane sugar, salt, and xanthan gum.</li>
        <li>When yeast mixture is frothy, pour it into the dry mix and add the 1/4 cup of oil.</li>
        <li>Turn the mixer on low, scraping down the sides as needed. Increase the mixer to medium-high speed and beat for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>The dough should look like a really thick batter and yet hold together in a ball when scraped down.</li>
        <li>Scrape the dough into a ball in the mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a tight-weave towel. Place it in a warm spot to rise for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While dough is rising, prepare the pan by greasing it lightly with coconut oil or neutral tasting oil.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Mix together the 1/3 cup sugar, cinnamon, and optional nutmeg.</li>
        <li>On parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, sprinkle a 1/4 cup of gluten free flour. (I'm talking one good 1/4 cup). Scoop the cinnamon roll dough onto the flour and sprinkle the top and sides generously.</li>
        <li>With flour on your hands, gently roll the dough into a ball, pressing the flour into the sides so it becomes less sticky.</li>
        <li>Use your floured hands to press the dough into a rectangle that is about 1/2-3/4 of an inch thick. Mine is almost the size of my baking silicone mat.</li>
        <li>Use a spoon to get small blobs of softened coconut oil and evenly distribute them all over the dough leaving about a half an inch around the edges so the filling doesn't pour out. If using butter, you can shred it and sprinkle it over the dough, or soften it and use the "small blob" method ðŸ˜‰</li>
        <li>Generously sprinkle all of the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the oil, once again leaving a 1/2 inch border around the edge.</li>
        <li>Here comes the only slightly tricky part. With the dough rectangle horizontal (longest side parallel to you), roll the dough starting from the side closest to you. Use the silicone mat or parchment paper to start the roll tightly, and then continue rolling with the parchment paper, very similarly to rolling up sushi. Don't roll the parchment paper or mat inside the cinnamon roll. Just use it by rolling from the bottom up. If it starts to stick at all, put extra flour or starch on the bottom and press it in with a spatula.</li>    
        <li>Cut the roll in half with a sharp knife dipped in flour or starch (wipe it in between each cut). Then cut each half in half again. Now divide each quarter into three rolls. Place the rolls tightly together in the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>If you are waiting to bake the cinnamon rolls until the morning, go ahead and wrap them in plastic wrap and place in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>To bake immediately, place place them uncovered in the preheated oven at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the cinnamon rolls cool slightly, make the frosting by whipping the softened oil or butter until it's creamy. Add in the powdered sugar, vanilla, and 2 tablespoons of the milk. Slowly mix it together, scraping down the sides as needed. Then increase the speed to medium high for 30 seconds. Add more milk if needed.</li>
        <li>Pour frosting over the top of the warm cinnamon rolls and serve. Note: To make a cream cheese frosting, replace oil with softened cream cheese (this is not dairy free).</li>
